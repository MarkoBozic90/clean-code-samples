# Clean Code Samples â€“ Sports Club CRM Application

This repository contains selected **code samples** from my production-grade **CRM microservice platform for sports clubs**.  
The full application is currently used by **17 clubs** with **1,000+ active users**, built on **Java 17, Spring Boot, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Redis, and ElasticSearch**, and deployed on **Azure Cloud**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
These classes are published here as a **portfolio showcase for Upwork clients and recruiters**.  
They demonstrate my **coding style, architecture decisions, and enterprise best practices** in Java & Spring Boot.

## ðŸ›  What you will see
- **DTOs with Java Records** â€“ clean, self-documenting data structures using annotations for validation and OpenAPI documentation.  
- **Caching & Redis Integration** â€“ efficient versioning and caching with ETag-style keys for performance optimization.  
- **Service Layer Design** â€“ scalable service implementations with batching, safe mapping, and robust error handling.  
- **Logging & Observability** â€“ structured logging with SLF4J to ensure traceability in production systems.  
- **Clean Architecture Principles** â€“ separation of concerns between DTOs, services, and infrastructure.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why this matters
As a developer, I believe code should be:
- **Readable** â†’ easy for teams to understand and extend.  
- **Reliable** â†’ backed by proper validation, caching, and testing.  
- **Scalable** â†’ designed to handle real-world load efficiently.  

These principles have helped me deliver enterprise projects for **SPAR International (2M+ daily transactions)**, **Porsche Informatik (1,000+ dealerships)**, and my own SaaS product (Sports Club CRM).
